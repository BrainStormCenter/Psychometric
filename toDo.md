# To do list for the Psychometric grant

January 4, 2018
* Goals for first set of data analyses
  * First manuscript
   * Are there differences in the correlations among the pain and DMN brain regions between the healthy controls and the (collapsed) chronic pain groups?
   * Are there group differences in the correlations among the pain and DMN brain regions before any mood manipulation?
 * Second manuscript
   * Are there group differences in the correlations among the pain and DMN brain regions before and after the manipulation of mood?
 * Third manuscript
   * Are there group differences in the correlations among the pain, DMN, and sleep brain regions (sleep regions to be added)



2017_12_08
* Figure out how to Run the GLM analyses
* Determine which order to run the scripts for estimating functional connectivity
* Figure out how to use the VOI file when estimating functional connectivity


2017_10_12
* Create a list of ROIs in various networks for upcoming analyses


2017_10_10
* Create a shell script for converting the raw dicom files to the nifti format. - COMPLETED 2017_10_11

2017_10_03
* fix the motion correction script. There is a mismatch between subject folders and the files contained within.


2017_10_02
* Create/add script to extract motion correction estimates from the preprocessed data.
* Use aforementioned script to get a reasonable estimate of how much useable date has already been collected.
* Determine how many subjects need to be recruited for each groups based upon the motion correction estimates.
* Look at the rate of recruitment over the last 6 months to evaluate our recruitment strategy and see if we will meet our planned enrollment goals.
